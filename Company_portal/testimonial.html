In my recent interview experiences, I attended multiple rounds and received offers from Google and Amazon. Over the past few years, the online community has helped me tremendously in preparation. With this post, I will share everything about my prep journey and contribute back my learnings. :)
SWE Interview Process.
The process usually kickstarts with the shortlisting of a potential candidate by a company recruiter. Candidate then goes through initial screening round(s), which determines if he/she is a good fit for the role. Once this is cleared, a typical SWE Interview will be conducted in below stages.
•	Coding — 3 to 5 rounds
•	System Design — 1 round
•	Leadership Principles — 1 round
P.S. I will focus more on Coding round preparation since these occupy a greater portion of the interview process. However, we will briefly look into System Design and LPs in later sections.
A. Coding
Software Engineers often find themselves in challenging situations e.g. dealing with ambiguity, unclear requirements, breaking down complex problems, handling edge cases, finalizing approach considering trade-offs, etc. Coding interviews are one way to get a glimpse of these skills.
To keep it simple — Coding rounds are focused on Problem Solving with Data Structures & Algorithms. These questions tend to be tricky and provide valuable insight into the candidate’s analytical ability.
Become sharp at solving Data Structures & Algorithm problems. This skill is gained over time. There’s no shortcut; only real formula is consistency. Practice, Practice, and Practice until you develop a natural problem-solving skill.
Preparation Strategy
1. Estimate Preparation Time
This is often ignored and not considered necessary. I suggest calibrating your current hold on problem-solving in DSA. I looked into my stronger and weaker areas and did a rough estimate of preparation time. This estimation helped me prepare my mind for the long-term (or short-term) goal and kept the motivation up.
“Give yourself sufficient preparation time. Its always better to be over-prepared than under-prepared.”
Total duration can vary depending on your expertise. At a broad level, I have categorized in below buckets.
•	Beginner — Can comfortably code in at least one programming language. Lacks basic knowledge of DS and Algos. Struggles (or takes considerable time) to solve Easy difficulty problems.
•	Intermediate — Good knowledge of DS and Algos. No problem with Easy difficulty. Can solve most Medium problems. Struggles with Hard.
•	Advanced — No problem with Medium difficulty. Able to solve most Hard problems.
I put myself at Intermediate level before interviews.

2. Coding and Learning Platforms
LeetCode, InterviewBit, and GFG were my leading go-to platforms for coding practice. Before the interviews, I solved around 320 LeetCode, 80 InterviewBit, and 30 GFG questions.
 
Problem Difficulty Distribution
Medium difficulty problems are essential as most of your interview questions will fall under this category. Solving these will immensely improve your speed and problem-solving ability.
It’s important to start with a mix of Easy and Medium level question at an early stage. Begin with Hard problems once you gain an adequate level of confidence. Don’t get demotivated if you are unable to solve the Hard ones. These problems can take a longer time to practice and perfect. Whenever I felt overwhelmed, I came back to an Easy for a motivation boost.
Maintain a growth mindset. Every problem you are unable to solve is an opportunity to learn something new.
•	LeetCode: Without a doubt, one of the best platforms out there. The best thing about LeetCode is its community. Discussion forums are super useful and provide multiple approaches. Don’t think twice about opting LeetCode Premium; it’s totally worth every penny.
•	InterviewBit: I highly recommend following the Programming Track. Experience on this platform is closest to a real interview. Sometimes your code passes all test cases but might not be time/space optimal (as required during an actual interview). InterviewBit reports these submissions as suboptimal, providing you additional feedback.
•	GFG: I utilized this platform majorly for problem discovery and DSA fundamentals. Topic explanations and language tailored implementations are really good. GFG also has a decent collection of company and topic-specific problems.
I did not wholly rely on a single resource for learning. Each resource provided me newer insights. I kept a journal, always aggregating and expanding my knowledge along the way.
•	Algorithms Specialization: This Coursera track rocks! It has a total of 4 courses, covering all basic and a few advanced DSA Topics. Great for beginners.
•	Youtube: Video explanations are my cup of tea! Naming few channels with helpful content — Rachit Jain, Abdul Bari, Tushar Roy (awesome walkthroughs!) and BackToBack SWE.
•	CTCI & EPI: I used these as supplemental to preparation. These books provided me with a quick brush up on Theory & Problems. It can sometimes feel time-consuming to target individual topics here. Instead, I opted to cover the sections breadth-wise before interviews.
•	CLRS: Sometimes used to lookup pseudocode. Handy resource to gain in-depth knowledge on time complexities and theory.
3. Using a Timer
As the interview durations are getting shorter, it’s crucial to work on your problem-solving pace. Generally, a coding interview is 45–50 mins long and a candidate is expected to solve — 2 x Medium OR 1 x Hard OR 1 x Easy plus 1 x Hard Follow-up.
Even if you could solve the initial question but consume a longer time, this means you won’t have sufficient time to tackle the second one.
I used a timer to time myself during problem-solving sessions.
•	Medium Problem: 20 mins
•	Hard Problem: 40–45 mins
Beginners can choose to ignore this factor since getting towards a correct solution is obviously more significant.
4. Mock Interviews
I gave a bunch of mock interviews before the actual ones. These can prove quite beneficial. Failing early in a test environment gives you useful insight. It will help you to detect the gaps in your thought process. Try to rectify each mistake and get better with every mock interview.
“If you crack consecutive mock interviews, consider it as a positive sign.”
•	[Free] LeetCode Mock Interview
•	[Free Peer-to-peer] Pramp
•	[Free Peer-to-peer] InterviewBit Mock Interview
Paid Mock Interviews come with additional benefits. Especially, Post-interview feedback gives lots of details on the interviewer’s expectations.
•	[Paid] ExpertMitra
•	[Paid] Mocki
•	[Paid] Technical Mock Interview
5. Prepare a roadmap
Until now, we spoke a lot about different elements that can go into preparation. Now let us try to connect these pieces together and create a roadmap!
Consider below snapshot of my calendar, a month before interview.
 

Preparation Schedule
•	On weekdays I could only allocate few hours as I was engaged in office work. I scheduled problem-solving sessions in this time-slot.
•	Theory topics were reserved for weekends when it was possible to dedicate a generous amount of time.
•	Closer to the interview, I scheduled Mocks. During the final weeks, I reduced coding sessions and focused more on reading CTCI and EPI.
